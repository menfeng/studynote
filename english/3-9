flying cats
how do cats try to protect themselves when falling from greate hights(heights)
cats never feel(fail) to facinate(fascinate) human beings
they can be friendly and factunate(affectionate) towards humans but they live(lead) mysterious lives of their own as well
they never become so misive(submissive) like dogs and horses
as a result humans have learned to respect feeline(feline) independence
most cat remain susfacients(suspicious) of humans all theirs lives
one of the things that facinate(fascinate) us most about cats is the popular beleave(blief) that they have nine lives
apparently their is a good deal of truth in this idea 
a cat's ability to survive fall is based on fact
recently the new york animal medical center made a study of 132 cats over a period of 5 mouth
all these cats have one experience in common they have vollen(fallen) off high buildings yet only 8 of their die of short or engeries(shock or injuries)
of course newyork is the ideal place for such an intresting study because their is no shorty each(shortage) of tall buildings
their all plenty of high rise window sells(windowsills) to form from
one cat s fall 32 storeys yet only suffer from a broken tooth
cats behave like well trained paratrabous(paratroopers) a doctor said\
it seems that the further cat fall the less they are likely to intres(injure) themselves
in a long drop the reach speeds of 60 miles an hour and more
at high speeds falling cats have time to relax
they streth out their legs like flying schares(squirrels)
this incereases their aeria distance(air resistance) and reduces of the shock of impact when they hit the groud

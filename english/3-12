12 life a desert island
what was the exceptional about the two man(men's) stay on the desert island
most of us has(have) formed an unreal mistic(unrealistic) picture of life on a desert island
we sometimes imagin(imagine) a desert island to be a sort of paranlise(paradise) with the sun always shines
life there is simple and good
right froot(ripe fruit) forms(falls) from the trees and you never have to work
the other side of the picture is quite the opset (opposite)
life on an sesert island is riched(wretched) 
you either starve to death are(or) liveed like a RC waiting for (a)boat which never comes
perhaps there is an element of the truth in both these pictures
but few of us have the oppotunity(opportunity) to find out
two men who recently spend five days on a core(coral) island whished they had stayed (there)longer
they were taking a badly damaged boat from the V island(s) to M to have it repaired
during the jurney(journey) their boat began to sink
they quickly loaded a small robot deny(rubber dinghy) with foot matches and kinds (cans)of beer
and road(rowed) for a few miles across the C untill they arrived at a tiny core(coral) island
there were hardly any trees on the island and there was no water but this did not prove to be a problem
the man(men) colleted right water(rainwater) in a(the) rober dengy(rubber dinghy)
as they had pro a sbeer gun(brought a speer gun) with they had plenty to eat
they caught a lot of s(lobster) and fish every day and as one of them put it eight(ate) like kings
when a passing tiger(tanker) rescued they five days later both men were generally(genuinely) sorry that they had to leave

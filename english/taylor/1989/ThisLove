Clear blue water, high tide came and brought you in
蔚海深蓝 潮水将你涌来
And I could go on and on, on and on, and I will
我所能做的 唯有继续行走
Skies grew darker, currents swept you out again
夜色渐浓 潮汐又将你带走
And you were just gone and gone, gone and gone
而你就此消失 我的身边再也没有你
In silent screams,
在无声的尖叫里
In wildest dreams
在疯狂的梦境里
I never dreamed of this
我却从未预料到这些
This love is good, this love is bad
这份爱时好时坏
This love is alive back from the dead
这份爱曾让我焕发新生
These hands had to let it go free
可我此刻不得不放开你的手
And this love came back to me
已逝之爱的潮汐又向我涌来
Tossing, turning, struggled through the night with someone new
夜里我难以入睡，辗转反侧 纠结着是否要重新开始
And I could go on and on, on and on
可我所能做的 就是继续前行，无法回头
Lantern burning, flickered in my mind for only you
烛光摇曳 闪现在我脑海里的只有你
But you're still gone, gone, gone
可你就此消失 我的身边再也没有你
Been losing grip,
曾经我难以自控
On sinking ships
像是沉没的船只
You showed up just in time
幸好你曾及时出现
This love is good, this love is bad
这份爱美好过也糟糕过
This love is alive back from the dead
这份爱曾让我涅重生
These hands had to let it go free
可我此刻不得不放开你的手
And this love came back to me
已逝之爱的潮汐又向我涌来
This love left a permanent mark
这份爱的印记永不磨灭
This love is glowing in the dark
这份爱在黑暗中永熠
These hands had to let it go free
可我此刻不得不放开你的手
And this love came back to me
已逝之爱的潮汐又向我涌来
This love, this love, this love, this love... [4x]
Your kiss, my cheek, I watched you leave
你的吻落在我的脸颊
Your smile, my ghost, I fell to my knees
我凝视着你远去 你的笑勾走我的灵魂 我甘愿拜倒在地
When you're young you just run
那时你太过年轻
But you come back to what you need
但你终究会回来并取你所需
This love is good, this love is bad
这份爱让我幸福过也让我痛苦过
This love is alive back from the dead
这份爱让我重获新生
These hands had to let it go free
可我此刻不得不放开你的手
And this love came back to me
已逝之爱的潮汐又向我涌来
This love left a permanent mark
这份爱的印记永不磨灭
This love is glowing in the dark
这份爱在黑暗中永熠
These hands had to let it go free
可我此刻不得不放开你的手
And this love came back to me
已逝之爱的潮汐又向我涌来
This love, this love, this love, this love... [4x]

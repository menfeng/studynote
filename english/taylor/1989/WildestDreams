他说让我们一起离开这小镇
He said, "Let's get out of this town,
驾车离开这城市 摆脱喧嚣的人群
Drive out of the city, away from the crowds."
我想即使是天堂也于事无济
I thought heaven can't help me now.
没有什么永垂不朽 但这都会把我深深蛊惑
Nothing lasts forever, but this is gonna take me down
他是那样的高大英俊
He's so tall and handsome as hell
明明那么糟糕，却萦绕在我的脑海中，挥之不去
He's so bad but he does it so well
从一开始我便对结局一目了然
I can see the end as it begins
我有一个条件是……
My one condition is
要你说会记住我
Say you'll remember me
一袭美裙
Standing in a nice dress,
远眺日落，宝贝
Staring at the sunset, babe
记住我绯红双唇，面若桃花
Red lips and rosy cheeks
要你说你会想起我
Say you'll see me again
即使只在你最狂野的梦境里
Even if it's just in your Wildest dreams, ah-ha ohh, Wildest dreams, ah-ha ohh.
我说没人会知道我们的事
I said, "No one has to know what we do, "
他的指尖轻抚我的发梢 他的衣服落在我的房间
His hands are in my hair, his clothes are in my room
他的声音是那么熟悉
And his voice is a familiar sound,
没有什么天长地久 但现在一切都在渐入佳境
Nothing lasts forever but this is getting good now
他是那么的高大英俊
He's so tall and handsome as hell
明明那么糟糕，却又那么完美
He's so bad but he does it so well
当我们最后一次拥吻
And when we've had our very last kiss
我最后的奢求是……
My last request it is
要你说会记住我
Say you'll remember me
一袭美裙
Standing in a nice dress,
远眺日落，宝贝
Staring at the sunset, babe
记住我绯红双唇，面若桃花
Red lips and rosy cheeks
要你说你会想起我
Say you'll see me again
即使只在你最狂野的梦境里
Even if it's just in your Wildest dreams, ah-ha ohh, Wildest dreams, ah-ha ohh.
事过境迁再相见
You see me in hindsight
整晚与你纠缠
Tangled up with you all night
燃烧殆尽
Burning it down
终有一天当在你离开我后
Someday when you leave me
我确信这些记忆 如影随形
I bet these memories Follow you around
You'll see me in hindsight
Tangled up with you all night Burning it down
Someday when you leave me
I bet these memories Follow you around
要你说会记住我
Say you'll remember me
一袭美裙
Standing in a nice dress,
远眺日落，宝贝
Staring at the sunset, babe
记住我绯红双唇，面若桃花
Red lips and rosy cheeks
要你说你会想起我
Say you'll see me again
即使只是逢场作戏
Even if it's just pretend
要你说会记住我
Say you'll remember me
一袭美裙
Standing in a nice dress,
远眺日落，宝贝
Staring at the sunset, babe
记住我绯红双唇，面若桃花
Red lips and rosy cheeks
要你说你会想起我
Say you'll see me again
即使只在你最狂野的梦境里
Even if it's just in your (just pretend, just pretend)
在你最狂野的梦境里
Wildest dreams, ah-ha ohh
即使只在你最狂野的梦境里
In your wildest dreams, ah-ha ohh
在你最狂野的梦境里[6] 
(Even if it's just in your wildest dreams) ah-ha
In your wildest dreams, ah-ha

You stand with your hand on my waistline
这幅场景早已无法隐埋
It's a scene and we're out here in plain sight
路人的蜚语萦绕我脑海
I can hear them whisper as we pass by
真悲哀
It's a bad sign, bad sign
隐秘泄出后发生了些事情
Something happens when everybody finds out
秃鹫萦绕 黑云压顶
See the vultures circling, dark clouds
爱如摇曳的火苗
Love's a fragile little flame
转瞬即熄 转瞬即熄
It could burn out, it could burn out
他们有笼子 箱子狩在一旁 枪响
Cause they got the cages, they got the boxes. and guns
我们是猎物 在猎人名单上 躲藏
They are the hunters, we are the foxes
And we run
宝贝 跟着我到这里隐秘踪迹
Baby
I know places we won't be found and
他们 会层层找寻我们的踪影
They'll be chasing their tails trying to track us down
快到这隐秘踪迹
Cause I know places we can hide
隐秘踪迹 隐秘踪迹
I know places...
灯在闪 我们躲篱墙旁
Lights flash
And we'll run for the fences
尽管叫嚣 都不放在心上
Let them say what they want
We won't hear it
言多必失 是前车之鉴 不能重演
Loose lips sink ships all the damn time, not this time
拉起我的手 牵着就不要放 情荡
Just grab my hand
And don't ever drop it
My love
我们是猎物 在猎人名单上 躲藏
They are the hunters, we are the foxes
And we run
宝贝 跟着我到这里隐秘踪迹
Baby, I know places we won't be found
他们 会层层找寻我们的踪影
And they'll be chasing their tails
trying to track us down
快到这隐秘踪迹
隐秘踪迹
Cause I, I know places we can hide
I know places
我们是猎物 在猎人名单上 躲藏
They are the hunters, we are the foxes
We run
拉起我的手 牵着就不要放 情荡
Just grab my hand and don't ever drop it
My love
Baby, I know places we won't be found
And they'll be chasing their tails trying to track us down
Cause I, I know places we can hide
I know places
枪林弹雨 我全然无畏
They take their shots but we're bullet proof
你我明了 我唯你相随
You know for me it's always you...
无尽黑夜 你绿瞳闪耀
In the dead of night, your eyes so green
我的重要 你早已明了
And I know for you, it's always me...

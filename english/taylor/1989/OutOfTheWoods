Looking at it now
回首往事
It all seems so simple
似乎一切都那么天真
We were lying on your couch
我们曾躺在沙发上
I remember
我仍记得
You took a Polaroid of us
你用相机拍的合照
Then discovered (then discovered)
然后发现
The rest of the world was black and white
世界黯然失色
But we were in screaming color
唯我们五彩斑斓
And I remember thinking…
记得我一直在想

Are we out of the woods yet?
我们脱离困境了吗
Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods?
Are we in the clear yet?
我们豁然开朗了吗
Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet?
In the clear yet?  Good
一切趋于明朗，很好
Are we out of the woods?
Looking at it now
回首往事
Last December (last December)
去年十二月
We were built to fall apart
Then fall back together (back together)
我们注定分手却又重归于好
Your necklace hanging from my neck
我戴着你的项链
The night we couldn't quite forget
我们毕生难忘的那个夜晚
When we decided (we decided)
我们决定了
To move the furniture so we could dance,
移开家具翩翩起舞
Baby, like we stood a chance
仿佛充满希望
Two paper airplanes flying, flying, flying
两个纸飞机翱翔蓝天
And I remember thinkin'
记得我一直在想
(Are we out of the woods?!)
Remember when you hit the brakes too soon?
记得你急踩刹车
Twenty stitches in the hospital room
病房里缝了20针
When you started cryin', baby, I did, too
当你开始哭泣时宝贝我也一样
But when the sun came up, I was lookin' at you
当旭日初升
Remember when we couldn't take the heat
我注视着你 记得我们再也承受不住
I walked out and said, "I'm settin' you free,"
我离开了，让你重获自由
But the monsters turned out to be just trees
妖魔鬼怪不过是枯枝败叶
And when the sun came up, you were lookin' at me
当旭日初升 你注视着我
You were lookin' at me
You were lookin' at me,
I remember, oh, I remember
记忆犹新

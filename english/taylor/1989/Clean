The drought was the very worst
干涸总是最痛苦的
When the flowers that we'd grown together died of thirst
当我们一起种的花因饥渴凋零
It was months, and months of back and forth
这场长达数月的来回拉锯
You're still all over me like a wine-stained dress I can't wear anymore
而你仍让我没辙，如同沾有酒渍的连衣裙，我再也无法穿着
Hung my head as I lost the war, and the sky turned black like a perfect storm
我已经被你羞辱得低下了头仿佛这场战争我已败北 天空被黑暗入侵像无懈可击的风暴
Rain came pouring down when I was drowning
雨倾盆而下，我慢慢沉溺
That's when I could finally breathe
但此时我才终于能呼吸
And by morning gone was any trace of you,
而那个早晨你无法寻觅
I think I am finally clean
我想我终于清净，不再留恋
There was nothing left to do
已经无事可做
When the butterflies turned to dust that covered my whole room
蝴蝶化为灰烬飘落整个房间
So I punched a hole in the roof
所以我在屋顶开了一个洞
Let the flood carry away all my pictures of you
让洪水带走你所有的照片
The water filled my lungs, I screamed so loud but no one heard a thing
水浸满我的肺 我大声尖叫却无人听见
Rain came pouring down when I was drowning
雨倾盆而下，我慢慢沉溺
That's when I could finally breathe
但此时我才终于能呼吸
And by morning, gone was any trace of you,
而那个早晨你无法寻觅
I think I am finally clean
我想我终于清净，不再留恋
I think I am finally clean
我想我终于清净，不再留恋
Said I think I am finally clean
看吧，我想我终于彻底放下
10 months sober, I must admit
十个月的冷静 我无法否认
Just because you're clean don't mean you don't miss it
只因你说你已释怀并不意味着你不再留恋
10 months older, I won't give in
十个月的成长 我不会屈服
Now that I'm clean I'm never gonna risk it
既然我已释怀我就绝不会再次冒险

The drought was the very worst
这里贫瘠如同荒漠
When the flowers that we'd grown together died of thirst
当我们一起种的花因饥渴凋零
Rain came pouring down when I was drowning
雨倾盆而下，我慢慢沉溺
That's when I could finally breathe
但此时我才终于能呼吸
And by morning gone was any trace of you,
而那个早晨你无法寻觅
I think I am finally clean
我想我终于释怀，不再留恋
Rain came pouring down when I was drowning
雨倾盆而下，我慢慢沉溺
That's when I could finally breathe
但此时我才终于能呼吸
And by morning gone was any trace of you
而那个早晨你无法寻觅
I think I am finally clean
我想我终于释怀，不再留恋
Finally clean
Think I'm finally clean
Think I'm finally clean

大概在婚礼前半个小时\Nit started about a half hour before the wedding.
我当时在存放礼品的房间里\NI was in the room where we were keeping all the presents,
看着调味汁瓶\Nand I was looking at this gravy boat.
那是一件极其美丽的里摩日细瓷调味汁瓶\NThis really gorgeous Limoges gravy boat.

然后我真的吓坏了\NAnd then I got really freaked out,
突然想到\Nand that's when it hit me:

不管怎么说  我必须离开那里\NAnyway, I just had to get out of there,
我开始想\Nand I started wondering
"我干吗这么做  我这么做是为了谁"\N"Why am I doing this, and who am I doing this for?"
不管怎么说  我不知该去哪里\NSo anyway I just didn't know where to go,

但是  你是我在这个城市\Nbut you're the only person I knew
唯一认识的人\Nwho lived here in the city.
还没有被邀请参加婚礼\NWho wasn't invited to the wedding.

爸爸  我只是  不能嫁给他\NDaddy, I just... I can't marry him!
对不起  我只是不爱他\NI'm sorry. I just don't love him.
可是对我来说就有关系\NWell, it matters to me!
噢  她真不应该穿那条裤子\NOoh, she should not be wearing those pants.
要我说  推她下楼\NI say push her down the stairs.
推她下楼  把推她下楼  把推她下楼\NPush her down the stairs! Push her down the stairs! Push her down the stairs!
爸  你听我说\NC'mon Daddy, listen to me!
这就好像  在我一生中\NIt's like, it's like, all of my life,
所有人都一直告诉我"你是一只鞋子\Neveryone has always told me, 'You're a shoe! 
你是鞋子  你是鞋子  你是鞋子\NYou're a shoe, you're a shoe, you're a shoe!'.
可今天我停下来说\NAnd today I just stopped and I said, 
"如果我不想成为一只鞋呢"\N'What if I don't wanna be a shoe?
如果我想当一个包包  或是一顶帽子呢\NWhat if I wanna be a- a purse, y'know? Or a- or a hat!
不  我不是要你给我买帽子\NNo, I'm not saying I want you to buy me a hat, 
我说我是一顶帽子\NI'm saying I am a ha-
这是比喻啦  爸爸\NIt's a metaphor, Daddy!
这就是他的问题所在了\NYou can see where he'd have trouble.
听着爸爸  这是我的人生\NLook Daddy, it's my life.
或许我可以和莫妮卡住在一起\NWell maybe I'll just stay here with Monica.
我猜和莫妮卡一起住的人选已然敲定了\NWell, I guess we've established who's staying here with Monica...

Hold on baby, you're losing it
坚持住，亲爱的，你在渐渐迷失
The water's high, you're jumping into it
你跳进深水
And letting go and no one knows
任由它带走你，反正没有人知道
 
That you cry but you don't tell anyone
你独自承受着悲伤
That you might not be the golden one
你或许不是天之骄女
And you're tied together with a smile
用一个微笑做自己
But you're coming undone
你却渐渐背离
 
I guess it's true that love was all you wanted

'Cause you're giving it away like it's extra change

Hoping it will end up in his pocket
希望它在他的口袋中消逝
But he leaves you out like a penny in the rain
而他冷落你如同雨中的便士
 
Oh, 'cause it's not his price to pay
因为这配不上他
Not his price to pay
配不上他

And you're tied together with a smile
用一个微笑做自己
But you're coming undone

你却渐渐背离
Goodbye, baby

With a smile, baby, baby

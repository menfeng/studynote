Tim McGraw

He said the way my blue eyes shined put those Georgia stars to shame that night
你说我的蓝眼睛的闪烁让当晚所有乔治亚的星星黯然失色
I said, "That's a lie."
我说：“你骗人”
Just a boy in a Chevy truck that had a tendency of gettin' stuck on back roads at night
有一个开着雪佛兰卡车的男孩 在我家后面那条路上 晚上常常车子抛锚
And I was right there beside him all summer long
整个夏天都陪在他身边
And then the time we woke up to find that summer gone
醒来时却发现夏天已经走远
But when you think Tim McGraw I hope you think my favorite song the one we danced to all night long
当你想起Tim McGraw 我希望你想起这首我最喜欢的歌 我们一整夜伴它起舞
The moon like a spotlight on the lake
月光像湖泊上的聚光灯
When you think happiness I hope you think that little black dress
当你想起你的幸福 我希望你想起“那条小黑裙”
Think of my head on your chest and my old faded blue jeans
想起我的头靠在你的胸怀 想起我那陈旧的褪色的牛仔裤
When you think Tim McGraw I hope you think of me
当你想起Tim McGraw 我希望你想起我

September saw a month of tears
整个九月只有眼泪相伴
And thankin' God that you weren't here to see me like that
感谢老天爷让你不在我身边 看着我流泪
But in a box beneath my bed is a letter that you never read
但是在我床下的一个盒子里 有一封你从未看过的信
From three summers back
三年前的那个夏天
It's hard not to find it all a little bitter sweet
觉得它是个甜蜜苦涩的回忆
And lookin' back on all of that, it's nice to believe
回首这一切，我欣然相信
When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think my favorite song
The one we danced to all night long
The moon like a spotlight on the lake
When you think happiness
I hope you think that little black dress
Think of my head on your chest
And my old faded blue jeans
When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think of me

And I'm back for the first time since then
从那时起我回到了最初
I'm standin' on your street
我站在街道上
And there's a letter left on your doorstep
你家的门外有一封信
And the first thing that you'll read is:
这是你第一次读到的东西

When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think my favorite song
Someday you'll turn your radio on
I hope it takes you back to that place
When you think happiness
I hope you think that little black dress
Think of my head on your chest
And my old faded blue jeans
When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think of me

Oh, think of me
Mmmm

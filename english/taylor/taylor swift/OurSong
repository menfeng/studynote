I was riding shot-gun with my hair undone
我坐在副驾驶位上，披头散发
in the front seat of his car
在他车的前排
He's got a one-hand feel on the steering wheel
他一手控制着方向盘
The other on my heart
另一只控制着我的心
I look around turn the radio down
我左顾右看，关掉电台广播
He says baby is something wrong
他说咋啦宝贝
I say nothing I was just thinking how we don't have a song
我说没啥啊
And he says
然后啊他就说
Our song is the slamming screen door
我们的歌是砰的关上的纱门
Sneakin' out late tapping on your window
深夜偷偷溜出去，敲你的窗户
When we're on the phone and you talk real slow
煲电话粥时你语调轻慢
Cause it's late and your mama don't know
因为已经很晚了，不想让你妈妈发现
Our song is the way you laugh
我们的歌是你的爽朗的笑声
The first date :"man,I didn't kiss her and I should have"
第一次约会后：“天啊，我在应该吻她时却没有吻”
And when I got home before I said amen
所以当我回到家，在说出结束祷告的“阿门”之前
Asking God if he could play it again
我请求上帝 能否让这一切再重来一遍

I was walking up the front porch steps
我那时正踏上前门走廊的阶梯
after everything that day
疲惫的一整天
Had gone all wrong or been trampled on
一切都错了，一切都被狠狠的践踏于脚下
And lost and thrown away
我迷失于其中，好像丢弃一切
Got to the hallway, well, on my way to my lovin' bed
走上走廊，只想躺倒在我心爱的床上
I almost didn't notice all the roses
差点没看到那一大束的玫瑰花飘香
And the note that said
和那张卡片，上面写着：
Our song is the slamming screen door
我们的歌是砰的关上的纱门
Sneakin' out late tapping on your window
深夜偷偷溜出去，敲你的窗户
When we're on the phone and you talk real slow
煲电话粥时你语调轻慢
Cause it's late and your mama don't know
因为已经很晚了，不想让你发现
Our song is the way you laugh

The first date man I didn't kiss her and I should have
那是第一次约会啊 我应该吻她但是我没有
And when I got home before I said amen
所以当我回到家，在说出结束祷告的“阿门”之前
Asking God if he could play it again
我请求上帝 能否让这一切再重来一遍
I've heard every album listened to the radio
我找遍了每一张专辑，收听着电台的歌
Waited for something to come along
等待某首歌响起
That was as good as our song
像我们的歌一样好听
Cause our song is the slamming screen door
我们的歌是砰的关上的纱门
Sneaking out late tapping on his window
深夜偷偷溜出去，敲他的窗户
When we're on the phone and he talks real slow

I was riding shot-gun with my hair undone
我坐在副驾驶位上，披头散发
In the front seat of his car
在他车的前排
I grabbed a pen and an old napkin
我抓起只笔 和随便一张旧的餐巾纸
And I wrote down our song
写下了属于我们的歌

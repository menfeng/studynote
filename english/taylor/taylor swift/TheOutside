Taylor在12岁那年写下了The Outside这首歌，描述的是她对乡村音乐的追求的过程中遭到同龄人的排斥，身处局外的孤独。

I didn\'t know what I would find
我不知道我会找到什么
When I went looking for a reason,i know
但我知道我是为了寻找一个理由
I didn\'t read between the lines
我没有领悟言外之意
And, baby I\'ve got nowhere to go
亲爱的，我不知该何去何从
I tried to take the road less travelled by
我试着不走老路
 
But nothing seems to work the first few times
但这无济于事
Am i right
我是对的吗
So how can I ever try to be better
我该怎么做
Nobody ever, lets me in
没有人肯接纳我
And I can still see you
我总算看见你了
This ain\'t the best view
但这不是我想要的情景
On the outside looking in
在外面远远地看着你
I\'ve been a lot of lonely places
我去过许多孤单的地方
I\'ve never been on the outside
但我从未去过外面
You saw me there, but never knew
你静静地看着我，却看不透我的心
That I would give it all up,To be
我愿意放弃一切
a part of this, a part of you
只为融入你的心
And now it\'s all too late,So you see
为时已晚
you could have helped if you had wanted to
你知道，只要你愿意你就可以改变这一切
 
But no one notices until it\'s too late to do anything
但你没有发觉，直到无法挽回
How could I ever, try to be better
我该怎么做
Nobody ever lets me in
没有人肯接纳我
And I can still see you
我总算看见你了
This ain\'t the best view
但这不是我想要的情景
On the outside looking in
在外面远远地看着你
I\'ve been a lot of lonely places
我去过许多孤单的地方
I\'ve never been on the outside
但我从未去过外面
 
How could I ever, try to be better
我该怎么做
Nobody ever lets me in
没有人肯接纳我
And I can still see you
我总算看见你了
This ain\'t the best view
但这不是我想要的情景
On the outside looking in
在外面远远地看着你
I\'ve been a lot of lonely places
我去过许多孤单的地方
I\'ve never been on the outside
但我从未去过外面

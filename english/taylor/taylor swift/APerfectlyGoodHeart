Maybe I should've seen the signs, should've read the writing on the wall.
也许我应该早看到一些迹象 早点发现不祥之兆
And realized by the distance in your eyes that I would be the one to fall.

No matter what you say, I still can't believe

That you would walk away.

It don't make sense to me, but:
我想不通

It's not unbroken anymore.
这再也不是完整的
How do I get it back the way it was before?
